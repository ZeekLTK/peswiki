The match ended 1-1 and Jamaica won the penalty shootout 4-3 to win their first title.<br /><br />Panama reached the final after finishing top of their group ahead of <a class="woas_link" title="" href="united_states.html">United States</a>, <a class="woas_link" title="" href="mexico.html">Mexico</a>, and <a class="woas_link" title="" href="trinidad_%26_tobago.html">Trinidad & Tobago</a>, having won all three matches against those opponents. This allowed them to bypass the quarterfinals and go straight to the semifinals. At this stage they wound up in a rematch against the United States in which they found themselves down a man thanks to a red card to <span class="woas_broken_link">Barahona</span> and also down 1-3. Panama surged from behind though, scoring 2 goals to force overtime, where they fell behind once again, 3-4. They managed to pull level one more time at 4-4, which meant the match had to be decided on penalties. Panama won the shootout to advance to the championship match.<br /><br />Jamaica also won their group, with wins over <a class="woas_link" title="" href="canada.html">Canada</a> and <a class="woas_link" title="" href="curacao.html">Curacao</a> despite a loss to <a class="woas_link" title="" href="costa_rica.html">Costa Rica</a> in between. Their record wasn't good enough to get a BYE, so they had to play in the quarterfinals. In that stage they met <a class="woas_link" title="" href="el_salvador.html">El Salvador</a>, who had just lost 7-1 to <a class="woas_link" title="" href="honduras.html">Honduras</a> in their last group stage match. Jamaica didn't quite score 7 goals, but they were close, and won 5-2 to progress to the semifinals where they then met Honduras. Neither side was able to score during regulation, so the match went to overtime. In this period Jamaica outscored Honduras 2-1 to secure their place in the final.<br /><br /><h1 class="woas_heading" id="S13860">Starting Lineups</h1><img src="http://us.i1.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/i/fifa/06/flag/sm2/pan.gif"> <a class="woas_link" title="" href="panama.html">Panama</a><br /><br />GK - <span class="woas_broken_link">Mejia</span><br />DF - <span class="woas_broken_link">Dasent</span><br />DF - <span class="woas_broken_link">L.

The game finally opened up in the second half when <span class="woas_broken_link">Quintero</span> headed in a cross (set up by a throw in) during the 65th minute to put Panama in the lead. Panama nearly doubled their lead a couple of times after that, but just couldn't manage to score again. This ultimately cost them, as Jamaica scored on a counter attack that was crossed in to <span class="woas_broken_link">Fuller</span>, who headed in the equalizer in the 78th minute. Neither team was able to score in overtime, so the match had to be decided with penalty kicks.<br /><br /><br />Possession: PAN 50 - 50 JAM<br />Shots: PAN 21 - 10 JAM<br />On Target: PAN 6 - 5 JAM<br />Free Kicks: PAN 7 - 11 JAM<br />Corner Kicks: PAN 8 - 3 JAM<br />Offsides: PAN 1 - 2 JAM<br />Yellow Cards: PAN 1 - 0 JAM<br /><br /><br /><h2 class="woas_heading" id="S8932">Penalty Kicks</h2>The match was decided on penalty kicks, where Jamaica won 4-3 after 9 shots apiece. Defender Marlon <span class="woas_broken_link">King</span> was the hero, as he made the winning shot.<br /><br /><h3 class="woas_heading" id="S14006">Shooting Summary</h3>Panama - Garces: O, L. Tejada: X, Bonaga: X, Quintero: X, A. Cooper: O, Godoy: O, L. Henriquez: X, Baloy: X, L. Moreno: X<br /><br />Jamaica -  Fuller: O, Hayles: X, Ziadie: X, Whitmore: O, Euell: X, A. Williams: O, Sinclair: X, Langley: X, King: O<br /><br />*(O = make, X = miss)<br /><br /><br /><h3 class="woas_heading" id="S18144">Tejada Controversy</h3><span class="woas_broken_link">L. Tejada</span> was still carrying an injury from the semifinals when he was subbed into the match in the 110th minute to replace a tired Renteria, which was Panama's last substitution. Even further, Tejada was then picked to be one of the "first five" shooters in the penalty shootout. Many critics felt that these decisions were what cost Panama the title.<br /><br />They feel that either Renteria should have remained on the field or that at least <span class="woas_broken_link">Godoy</span> should have moved up in the penalty order, and point to the fact that he made his spotkick as evidence that Panama would have won 3-2 after 5 shots, rather than losing 3-4 after 9 if Godoy had been in the top 5 of the order and not Tejada. The manager argued that Tejada was well rested and that he was still one of their best offensive weapons despite the injury. He said that he did consider moving Godoy up, but felt that Tejada was more likely to score.<br /><br /><br /><h2 class="woas_heading" id="S1591">Goals</h2><span class="woas_broken_link">Quintero</span> headed in a cross from <span class="woas_broken_link">Renteria</span> in the 65th minute (this was his third goal of the tournament)<br /><br /><span class="woas_broken_link">Fuller</span> headed in a cross from <span class="woas_broken_link">Whitmore</span> in the 78th minute (this was Fuller's 6th goal of the tournament and won him the scoring title)</div><div id="woas_mts">Last modified: ?5?/?29?/?2014? ?9?:?42?:?55? ?AM</div></div></div></body></html>
