Wiltord was eventually subbed out for <span class="woas_broken_link">Fanchone</span>.<br /><br />This was Guadeloupe's last chance to climb out of the #9 spot during Week 1. They had previously failed to move up thanks to a 2-2 draw against #8 Oman in the very first challenge match of the season. The team was motivated to play better this time around, but no one could have predicted such improvement so quickly.<br /><br />Guadeloupe scored early, but nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Oman pressed forward looking for an equalizer. Guadeloupe managed to strike again to give themselves a cushion, but Oman started to crumble and conceded three more goals before half time. Going into the break Guadeloupe lead 5-0, having scored that many goals off only 8 shots.<br /><br />In the second half, Guadeloupe decided to keep pressing forward and after a few more shots went in, they seemed eager to run up the score as much as possible to set some records. They wound up scoring seven more in the second half, despite having a penalty kick saved, and closed out the game with a final score of 12-0! They became the first team to score more than 8 goals in a game and broke the records for: most goals by one team in a game (previously 8), largest margin of victory (previously 8), and most combined goals in a game (previously 10).<br /><br />Seven different players scored in this game, which included two hattricks for Guadeloupe strikers Wiltord and Biabiany, a brace for Saha, and individual goals for Dacourt, Gouffran, and Antoine-Curier, as well as an own goal from Oman. Eight of the goals came from assists, with Saha providing 3, Wiltord and Biabiany each providing 2, and Zubar 1. Saha had a chance for a hattrick, but his penalty kick was saved by Al-Habsi.<br /><br />Wiltord received a 9.0 rating for the match, while Biabiany received an 8.0. Oman's keeper Al-Habsi received a 4.0, and may have been credited with the own goal.<br /><br /><br />Possession: OMA 45 - 55 GWA<br />Shots: OMA 6 - 22 GWA<br />On Target: OMA 2 - 19 GWA<br />Free Kicks: OMA 6 - 4 GWA<br />Corner Kicks: OMA 1 - 5 GWA<br />Offsides: OMA 0 - 0 GWA<br />Yellow Cards: OMA 2 - 0 GWA<br /><br /><br /><br /><h2 class="woas_heading" id="S1591">Goals</h2>Wiltord - 3 goals, 2 assists<br />Biabiany - 3 goals, 2 assists<br />Saha - 2 goals and 3 assists<br />Dacourt - 1 goal<br />Gouffran - 1 goal<br />Antoine-Curier - 1 goal<br />Zubar - 1 assist<br /><br />Only the last six goals were saved by the post-game replay to know the exact time and scorer:<br />49' Wiltord (Zubar) - Wiltord received the ball on the right wing, cut in to beat his defender and then fired in a shot once inside the box.<br />54' Biabiany - Boxed out his defender to receive the ball inside the box, then turned and scored.<br />63' Wiltord (Saha) - Cut in past his defender again and then fired a shot from just outside the box that beat the keeper.<br />79' Biabiany (Saha) - Headed in a cross from a free kick.<br />83' Saha - Knocked in a rebound off a corner kick.<br />87' Antoine-Currier - Knocked in a rebound off a corner kick.<br /><br /><br /><br /><h2 class="woas_heading" id="S13087">Season 2 Results</h2>This match was a turning point in the season for Guadeloupe, as they carried the momentum of this result to build a 7 game winning streak and 9 game unbeaten streak. However, most of their wins were much closer and competitive. Following this victory, Guadeloupe went on to defeat <a class="woas_link" title="" href="austria.html">Austria</a> 2-1 to win the #7 spot and then defeated <a class="woas_link" title="" href="scotland.html">Scotland</a> by the same scoreline in the first league match of the season. A pair of 1-0 wins over both <a class="woas_link" title="" href="belarus.html">Belarus</a> and then <a class="woas_link" title="" href="switzerland.html">Switzerland</a>, followed by a 2-1 win over <a class="woas_link" title="" href="finland.html">Finland</a> and a 3-1 win over <a class="woas_link" title="" href="uruguay.html">Uruguay</a> saw the team ascend into the #3 position by the Week 2 League Match. This was where the winning streak ended, with a 0-0 draw against <a class="woas_link" title="" href="australia.html">Australia</a>. They would then beat <a class="woas_link" title="" href="morocco.html">Morocco</a> 2-0 to reach the #2 position on the roster before finally losing their first game of the season in Week 3, Challenge Match 10; a 1-0 loss to #1 <a class="woas_link" title="" href="mozambique.html">Mozambique</a>.</div><div id="woas_mts">Last modified: ?11?/?13?/?2016? ?11?:?05?:?43? ?PM</div></div></div></body></html>
