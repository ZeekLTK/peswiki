Van Nisterlrooy</h1><span class="woas_broken_link">Van Nistelrooy</span> played for <a class="woas_link" title="" href="netherlands.html">Netherlands</a> and lead them to the first ever <a class="woas_link" title="" href="world_cup.html">World Cup</a> championship match in <a class="woas_link" title="" href="world_cup_i.html">World Cup I</a>, where they played <a class="woas_link" title="" href="france.html">France</a> to a 2-2 draw and settled for silver medals after losing the penalty shootout. Van Nistelrooy also helped Netherlands to the quarterfinals of the <a class="woas_link" title="" href="world_series.html">World Series</a> and was one of the top scorers in <a class="woas_link" title="" href="world_cup_iii.html">World Cup III</a>, an honor which won him the bronze boot. Overall, Netherlands were always a strong opponent and Van Nistelrooy was a player no defender liked to see line up across from him.<br /><br /><br /><h1 class="woas_heading" id="S5457">9. Kanoute</h1><span class="woas_broken_link">Kanoute</span> played for <a class="woas_link" title="" href="mali.html">Mali</a> and lead them to two championship appearances, though they ultimately fell short at the last hurdle, taking second in both the <a class="woas_link" title="" href="world_series.html">World Series</a> and <a class="woas_link" title="" href="world_cup_v.html">World Cup V</a>. Kanoute was the biggest reason for Mali's success as he constantly lead the team in scoring, which earned him a couple scoring awards including the silver boot in both of those competitions as he netted 5 goals in World Cup V and 25 in the World Series.<br /><br /><br /><h1 class="woas_heading" id="S6572">8. Bakayoko</h1><span class="woas_broken_link">Bakayoko</span> was relatively unknown when he started his career for <a class="woas_link" title="" href="cote_d%27ivoire.html">Cote d'Ivoire</a>, but he ultimately proved himself to be one of the best players in the game, helping his nation to win a <a class="woas_link" title="World Cup III" href="world_cup_iii.html">World Cup</a> and a bronze medal. He was also a scoring machine, netting 23 goals in the World Series to take the bronze boot from that competition as well as 6 in Cote d'Ivoire's championship run which lead the team in scoring and earned him the silver boot.<br /><br /><br /><h1 class="woas_heading" id="S1729">7. Flo</h1><span class="woas_broken_link">Flo</span> was an integral part of <a class="woas_link" title="Norway" href="norway.html">Norway</a>'s success, helping his country win two World Cups (<a class="woas_link" title="World Cup V" href="world_cup_v.html">V</a> & <a class="woas_link" title="World Cup VI" href="world_cup_vi.html">VI</a>) as well as a bronze at <a class="woas_link" title="" href="world_cup_ii.html">World Cup II</a>. He was one of the top scorers during World Cup V as well, earning a bronze boot for his 4 goals.<br /><br /><br /><h1 class="woas_heading" id="S8016">6. Trezeguet</h1><span class="woas_broken_link">Trezeguet</span> was suppose to be overshadowed by his illustrious <a class="woas_link" title="France" href="france.html">French</a> teammates, but the striker proved to be too good to stay out of the headlines. His towering presence always caused opposing teams problems and he recorded a number of goals to prove it. An important key to France's early run of 3 straight trips to the championship match which yielded 1 gold and 2 silvers was also complemented by a strong showing in World Cup V where Trezeguet won the bronze boot.<br /><br /><br /><h1 class="woas_heading" id="S4127">5. Drogba</h1><span class="woas_broken_link">Drogba</span> may have had plenty of good teammates, but he was undoubtedly the biggest reason for <a class="woas_link" title="Cote d'Ivoire" href="cote_d%27ivoire.html">Cote d'Ivoire's</a> success. After winning <a class="woas_link" title="" href="world_cup_iii.html">World Cup III</a>, Drogba continued to dominate at the highest level by winning the silver boot in the following World Cup and then becoming a World Cup top scorer by taking the golden boot at <a class="woas_link" title="" href="world_cup_v.html">World Cup V</a> where he once again lead his country to a medal, this time a bronze.<br /><br /><br /><h1 class="woas_heading" id="S7839">4. Solskjaer</h1>A back-to-back World Cup champion, <span class="woas_broken_link">Solskjaer</span> was arguably the best <a class="woas_link" title="Norway" href="norway.html">Norwegian</a> player ever. His leadership was the main reason for Norway's late climb to dominance, but he had also helped win a bronze medal earlier in his career as well. He lead by example too, leading his team in scoring in both World Cups which Norway won, taking the silver boot from <a class="woas_link" title="" href="world_cup_v.html">World Cup V</a> and then leading the entire tournament in scoring at <a class="woas_link" title="" href="world_cup_vi.html">World Cup VI</a>.<br /><br /><br /><h1 class="woas_heading" id="S6558">3. Iashvili</h1><span class="woas_broken_link">Iashvili</span> became one of the most famous players in WE thanks to a number of important goals that he scored early on in his career to help <a class="woas_link" title="" href="georgia.html">Georgia</a> win three championships over the span of four tournaments (<a class="woas_link" title="" href="world_cup_ii.html">World Cup II</a>, <a class="woas_link" title="" href="world_series.html">World Series</a>, and <a class="woas_link" title="" href="world_cup_iv.html">World Cup IV</a>). The star of Georgia was eventually subdued later in his career thanks to nagging injuries, but no one can forget the impact he made when he first burst onto the scene, scoring Georgia's first ever goal in that famous qualifying win against <a class="woas_link" title="" href="austria.html">Austria</a>, as well as the game clinching goal in the World Cup II final against France.<br /><br /><br /><h1 class="woas_heading" id="S3457">2. Henry</h1><a class="woas_link" title="" href="henry.html">Henry</a> was unquestionably the most talented player in the game. His skills were unmatched during the first three World Cups where he lead <a class="woas_link" title="" href="france.html">France</a> to the championship match three times in a row, a feat that has yet to be matched by any nation. Though they never actually won a game in the finals (they did win a World Cup on penalties), Henry was such a force that no team could stop him, as shown by his golden boot award from <a class="woas_link" title="" href="world_cup_iii.html">World Cup III</a> as well as his silver boot from <a class="woas_link" title="" href="world_cup_v.html">World Cup V</a>. With him, France reached the quarterfinals or further in 5 of the 7 major competitions, and as mentioned, went all the way to the championship in 3 of them. Henry's defining performance came in the World Cup III group stage where France entered the last matchday needing a victory to advance. Henry scored FIVE goals en route to a 5-0 win over <a class="woas_link" title="" href="uruguay.html">Uruguay</a> to ensure France's advancement to the next round.<br /><br /><br /><h1 class="woas_heading" id="S6491">1. Ashvetia</h1><span class="woas_broken_link">Ashvetia</span> also played a key role in <a class="woas_link" title="Georgia" href="georgia.html">Georgia's</a> rise to prominence, but initially didn't garner as much media attention as his teammate <span class="woas_broken_link">Iashvili</span>. Over time though, it became apparent who was really the driving force behind Georgia's success after he scored the "Goal of the Century" to secure victory against <a class="woas_link" title="" href="france.html">France</a> in the <a class="woas_link" title="" href="world_cup_ii.html">World Cup II</a> championship and then won the golden boot for scoring in the <a class="woas_link" title="" href="world_series.html">World Series</a> with an astonishing 27 goals. He followed that up by scoring the first goal, and thus the game winner, against the <a class="woas_link" title="" href="united_states.html">United States</a> in the <a class="woas_link" title="" href="world_cup_iv.html">World Cup IV</a> championship which Georgia won 2-0. Ashvetia was the most honored player in WE8 history, with three championship trophies from <a class="woas_link" title="" href="georgia.html">Georgia</a> as well as 3 individual scoring awards; a bronze boot from <a class="woas_link" title="" href="world_cup_iv.html">World Cup IV</a> and a silver boot from <a class="woas_link" title="" href="world_cup_v.html">World Cup V</a> to go with his golden boot from the World Series.</div><div id="woas_mts">Last modified: ?5?/?27?/?2014? ?4?:?03?:?15? ?PM</div></div></div></body></html>
