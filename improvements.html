Every Help page now opens in the Help system, except the <a class="woas_link" title="WoaS::Help::" href="woas__help__.html">namespace listing</a> and the <a class="woas_link" title="" href="woas__help.html">WoaS::Help</a> information page. This allows the Help system to become an active guide to using the wiki, as links to the main wiki clicked from within a Help page opens in the main wiki (as they always did). Help page links can now target page sections in the Help system and also in the main wiki.</li></ul><ul><li>Namespace listings have been, IMHO, greatly improved in styling, and also in capability. The <a class="woas_link" title="" href="special__all_pages.html">Special::All Pages</a> listing (renamed for consistency with the other special pages) now also lists no-namespace pages in a fold (they used to overwhelm the listing in large files). I intend to add the capability to select a listing style within the page link in the new project. The <a class="woas_link" title="" href="special__orphaned_pages.html">Special::Orphaned Pages</a> code has been rewritten so that it completes in the square-root of the time it used to take (important in a wiki with hundreds of pages), and the <a class="woas_link" title="" href="tagged__.html">Tagged::</a> listing now allows some really powerful listings if, like me, you make extensive use of tags. The <a class="woas_link" title="" href="image__.html">Image::</a> listing is also -- again IMHO -- much improved and has styles added for those who want complete control of the presentation.</li></ul><h2 class="woas_heading" id="S2358">Layout</h2><ul><li>I have spent a huge number of hours updating the CSS and HTML layout and checking it across popular browsers, with generally pleasing results. Layout now stays consistent across most text size and zoom changes. (For some reason Opera seems to make all the text bigger than other browsers, but this is easily changed with the 'zoom' control.)</li></ul><ul><li>The layout now adjusts to very long page titles.</li></ul><ul><li>Links to headings will now appear below the header instead of behind it. This has removed the need for a semi-transparent header. The linking system has also been fixed/improved, allowing a section to be linked to when loading the file (<tt class="woas_nowiki">woas.html?my page#section</tt>) and not creating browser history when clicked in the TOC. The code has been refactored so that legal section heading are used internally that also have a much smaller chance of conflicting within a page. These may be made more accessible in the new project as either the usual form or the internal form (e.g.: #S123) can now be used.<ul><li>The file load section doesn't work in all browsers yet as the '#' is interpreted as a section to jump to, putting it behind the header. In the new project this will not be an issue, so I have not spent much time trying to fix it. I am willing to fix this if it is a felt need.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>The TOC code has been rewritten to allow a lot more control of presentation and is now foldable. I don't want a numbered TOC so the current CSS reflects that fact; if there is a demand I will create plugins for various views, including the old numbering (I have created the code for this in testing, including full section numbering; e.g. 2.1.9). The new code allows the TOC to start at any heading level without errors.</li></ul><ul><li>I have changed the order of the navigation icons a little to be more consistent (mostly, it stops the <em>Help</em> icon moving around when switching to <em>edit</em> mode), and updated & minimized the icons. The lock icon view has been reversed as it was very confusing; they now reflect what will be done when clicked, just like the other icons, not the status of the page. The CSS styling for a locked page has also been changed to a red border on locked pages and can be easily modified through custom CSS, including returning the original display.<br><br>I am rewriting the code so icons can be easily moved to any position (mostly for Little Girl & <a class="woas_world_link" title="http://bookonastick.wordpress.com" href="http://bookonastick.wordpress.com" target="_blank">BoaS</a>'s sake), though the new project will make this unnecessary because the layout will come from layout pages that are rendered on load.</li></ul><ul><li>The editor has been improved in that it now acts as a single page (if there is enough screen layout available), removing the double scrollbars that used to appear. It works well across all browsers, including IE6. I was going to do the same with the view layout (and developed code to do so, allowing fixed layout in all browsers) but have decided to wait and do it in the new project. I also need to decide whether to add image capabilities to IE6&7 in the new project as I have code written that can do so. Would be interested in feedback on this.</li></ul><h2 class="woas_heading" id="S2982">Parsing</h2><ul><li>Most URLs, like <a class="woas_world_link" href="https://example.com/page?hi#there" target="_blank">https://example.com/page?hi#there</a>, will be recognized and kept from being seen as text markup (try this page in 0.12.0). If <em>Automatically convert URLs to hyperlinks</em> is turned on in the <a class="woas_link" title="Special::Options#User Interface" href="special__options.html#S10406">User Interface</a> section of <a class="woas_link" title="" href="special__options.html">Special::Options</a>, and the URL is recognized (http, https, file, ftp) then the URL will also be automatically turned into an external wiki link. This doesn't fix UNIX paths, but as long as the path doesn't have a leading slash, it should be rendered correctly: my/path/t. In my new project I want to add syntax, consistent with Creole 1, that stops the next character (or perhaps next syntax block; e.g: '{|') from being interpreted as markup. (There are many other ways to accomplish this as well, like recognizing backslash escapes within the line.)</li></ul><ul><li>In-line syntax for text styling -- italics, bold, underline -- all work the same in that they cannot cross lines of text (in 0.12.0 underline would work across lines). Other than that I have now returned to the original parsing rules for 0.12.0 with the exception that bold markup can start after "/" and "\"; I can't see why this existed other than for file path display (where it fails in many instances). Italics cannot start after a colon (':'), presumably also to protect file paths; this is standard behaviour in 0.12.0. I am considering protecting file paths in my new project in much the same way as I have now protected URLs (by removing them from parsing).</li></ul><h1 class="woas_heading" id="S4400">Bug Fixes</h1><em>See my <strong><a class="woas_world_link" title="http://stickwiki.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/stickwiki/branches/pvhl/fix/log.txt" href="http://stickwiki.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/stickwiki/branches/pvhl/fix/log.txt" target="_blank">log.txt</a></strong> in SVN for a fuller list of fixes.

Layout is now consistent at all text sizes and zoom levels in all major browsers (in Windows; I have done only limited testing for Linux, and none at all for Mac). I have been able to test early versions of IE and Firefox, but have no ability (or real desire) to test early versions of Chrome, Opera, and Safari. <em>I also had not realized how many load|save related WoaS features only work in Firefox! I have code to make image embedding work in IE, but adding such capabilities to the other browsers will have to be limited and based either on a new Java system, or HTML 5.</em></li></ul><ul><li>Most history and navigation icon errors have been removed.</li></ul></div></div></div></body></html>
